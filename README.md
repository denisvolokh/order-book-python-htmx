# Render Exchange Order Book with FastAPI and HTMX

I’ve been playing around with HTMX recently, and I wanted to build something fun and interactive to really see what it could do. So, I put together a project to simulate a stock exchange order book — nothing too crazy, just some bid and ask prices updating on the screen.
While this setup uses polling (which means it checks for updates every second), it gave me a good chance to explore how HTMX can make parts of a webpage update without a full refresh. It’s not real-time (I’ll cover that in a future post), but it gets pretty close to the feel of it.
